# Node TypeScript Playground
A project for rapid prototyping in a node environment.

## Project setup
Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Developing
There are two methods for developing and debugging TypeScript code in this repo:
- `yarn dev` runs the `main.ts` file in node and will re-run the script on any file changes.

- In VS Code's Run and Debug tab, clicking "Run script" starts an editor debugging session and allows breakpoints to be set.
